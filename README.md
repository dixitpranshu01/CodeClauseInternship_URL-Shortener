1. Developed a URL Shortener web application using FastAPI framework to create short URLs from long URLs, enhancing user-friendliness and sharing ease.
2. Implemented a hash-based approach to generate a consistent short URL for a given long URL using the MD5 hash function, ensuring the same long URL consistently produces the same short URL.
3. Utilized in-memory storage to manage the mapping between short URLs and their corresponding long URLs, optimizing performance and reducing database dependencies.
4. Designed a responsive and visually appealing front-end using HTML and CSS to provide a user-friendly interface for users to input long URLs and receive corresponding short URLs.
5. Incorporated background image and blur effects using CSS to enhance the aesthetics of the web application, creating an engaging user experience.
6. Utilized the POST method to handle URL shortening requests and the GET method to redirect from short URLs to their original long URLs, improving navigation efficiency.
7. Integrated StaticFiles and mounting to serve static HTML and image files, facilitating a seamless integration of front-end components with the FastAPI backend.
8. Demonstrated proficiency in Git version control to manage codebase, track changes, and collaborate with team members during development.
9. Deployed the web application using Uvicorn and localhost, providing a real-time environment for testing and development.
10. Collaborated with team members to troubleshoot and debug issues, contributing to a successful and functional URL Shortener application.
11. Effectively documented the codebase, including usage of libraries, functions, and endpoints, enhancing code readability and ease of maintenance.
